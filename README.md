# Papers We ❤️ Porto

This is the repository for the Porto chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter, we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/porto/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

### Information

In the spirit of the "Papers We Love" groups around the globe, we want to start our own version in Porto.

Within the realm of computing, which is your favorite paper, the one that inspired or taught you the most, and which you want to tell the rest of the group about? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research publication with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers.

Present the paper, show how you've implemented and used it, or simply discuss!

We're curating this repository for papers presented at Papers We Love @ Porto. You can contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories, like the main Papers We Love repo, here.
